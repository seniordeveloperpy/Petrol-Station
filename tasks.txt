Petrol Station Project Overview
The Petrol Station project is a Django-based web application designed to manage and operate a network of petrol stations. It includes models for different types of fuel (petrol, gas, and electric), and provides an API to manage petrol stations, fuel types, fuel prices, vehicles, and refueling records. The project leverages Django REST Framework to create a robust API for interacting with the database models.
